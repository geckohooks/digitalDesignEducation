# Creative Coding Basics

## What is Creative Coding?
As Mark Mitchell and Oliver Brown suggest, **Creative Coding** is '...a discovery-based process consisting of exploration, iteration, and reflection, using code as a primary medium, towards a media artefact designed for an artistic context.' (2013, p.143) It's different from traditional **Software Development** because it's geared towards arts and design approaches, and its method is chiefly about **creation through experimentation** (i.e. trying things out and seeing what works), rather than the more laborious and formulaic approaches of Computer Science. 

Creative Coding is an essential part of the Digital Media Design course, which itself seeks to fuse art, design and technology - exploring the amazing things that happen when creative people collaborate with technology! In this sense, we draw on the 1920s legacy of The Bauhaus, the 1960s emergence of Cybernetics, the rise of New Media in the 1990s and 2000s, and with the more recent (2000s - present day) flourishing of Creative Coding and Design Thinking.
