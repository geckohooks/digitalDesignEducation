http://leduchamp.com is a single page website created by Rafaël Rozendaal that depicts Marcel Duchamp's 1913 artwork [Bicycle Wheel](https://blog.singulart.com/en/2020/05/01/bicycle-wheel-1913-the-story-of-marcel-duchamps-pioneering-style/). It seems to have been made using clip art, but if the user clicks, drags, or scrolls over the piece, they find that this is not a static image: the wheel spins and stops according to their interaction. Furthermore, as it spins, the evocative clicking of a bicycle wheel spinning can be heard, creating the illusion of a 'real' wheel spinning.

The visual style references a "clip art" aesthetic - indeed, although there's no information about how this piece was made, in all likelihood the artwork was produced by editing existing clip art.
