leduchamp.com is a single page website created by Rafaël Rozendaal that depicts Marcel Duchamp's 1913 artwork Bicycle Wheel. It seems to have been made using clip art, but if the user clicks, drags, or scrolls over the piece, they find that this is not a static image: the wheel spins and stops according to their interaction. Furthermore, as it spins, the evocative clicking of a bicycle wheel spinning can be heard, creating the illusion of a 'real' wheel spinning.

The visual style references a "clip art" aesthetic - indeed, although there's no information about how this piece was made, in all likelihood the artwork was produced by editing existing clip art.
