# Code Art History Task
## DAT443 Creative Coding | Autumn 2022

### Overview
We would like to develop a Code Art History timeline collaboratively with you. We'll take care of the coding element to make this an interactive platform, but during this module, we'd like each of you to write a single entry for the timeline. Pick one creative coding artwork, from one of the list of references shared here (https://github.com/geckohooks/digitalDesignEducation/blob/main/README.md), and write 300 words describing and analysing the project. You also need to find 1 or 2 images of the artwork. 

### What do we mean by Description and Analysis?
Maybe this sounds like a stupid question - we all know what these terms mean right? It's true that description is about saying what you see - i.e. a "spoken or written account of a person, object, or event". But what is its role here? 

The idea of this timeline is to inform others (who perhaps don't know anything about the history of Code Art / Creative Coding) about this artwork. The audience have probably never seen the artwork, or heard of the artist, and they may even find the idea that art can be made on computers to be a bit baffling! As such, please include some basic information about the artwork - title, date, artist, format, any links if they exist - and any information on the purpose or motivation of the artist. Since you're going to include images of the work, you don't need to reiterate what the reader can already see. But often creative coding is made using processes that aren't immediately obvious - so describing process or intentions of the artist is useful. Don't go into lots of biographical detail about the artist. This task is about the artwork and the craft of creative coding, not the people as such.

What about analysis? If description is about what, where, when etc. then analysis is about 'so what'. In other words, it explains the impact or consequence of a situation. That might mean, the impact or consequence of the artwork: "this was one of the first algorithmic artworks, that intitiated interest in this way of working", or the consequence of some specific aspect you've described: "This artwork was created on a mainframe computer" (Description) so... "It had to be calculated on paper first, then transformed into code via punch cards, then fed into the computer" (analysis).

### Being Methodical
In order for this submission to be high quality, it will need to be planned, researched, edited... and group critique / peer feedback is an important part of this. 

Please follow these steps:

1) Research the list of artists/artworks provided widely. Read around the topic. Make notes.
2) Narrow down which you'd like to write about on the basis of a) which you think are the most interesting projects / artists and b) which artworks you feel you have something interesting to talk about! 
3) Discuss your options in class - which you would like to talk about AND what you could say
4) Write a draft (and select/include images) and share it with your tutor
5) Refine and improve 
6) Submit
 
### Submission Details
To submit, please create **a public post** on notion.io and submit the URL (address) for the post via the Task 1 eSubmission, found on the DAT443 DLE page. The post should be 300 words (+/- 10%); Harvard Referenced; and without any spelling or grammatical errors. The post should contain 1-2 good images of the artwork discussed if they are available.
