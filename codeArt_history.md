# Code Art History Task
## DAT443 Creative Coding | Autumn 2022

### Overview
We would like to develop a Code Art history / timeline collaboratively with you. We'll take care of the coding element to make this an interactive platform, but for this module, we'd like each of you to write a single entry to this timeline. Picking a single creative coding artwork from one of the list of references shared here, please write 500 words.
