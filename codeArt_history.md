# Code Art History Task
## DAT443 Creative Coding | Autumn 2022

### Overview
We would like to develop a Code Art History timeline collaboratively with you. We'll take care of the coding element to make this an interactive platform, but during this module, we'd like each of you to write a single entry for the timeline. Pick one creative coding artwork, from one of the list of references shared here (https://github.com/geckohooks/digitalDesignEducation/blob/main/README.md), and write 300 words describing and analysing the project. You also need to find 1 or 2 images of the artwork. 

### What's Meant by Description and Analysis?


### Being Methodical
In order for this submission to be high quality, it will need to be planned, researched, edited... and importantly, discussed with your tutor at every stage. Please follow these steps:
1) Research the list of artists/artworks provided widely. Read around the topic. Make notes.
2) Narrow down which you'd like to write about on the basis of a) which you think are the most interesting projects / artists and b) which artworks you feel you have something interesting to talk about! 
3) Discuss your options with your tutor: which you would like to talk about AND what you could say
4) Write a draft (and select/include images) and share it with your tutor
5) Refine and improve go back to step 4 until the writing is strong
6) Submit
